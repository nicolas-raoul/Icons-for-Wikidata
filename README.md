# Icons for Wikidata

Our goal is to provide a stylistically coherent set of icons for the main Wikidata classes. These icons can be used as pins to show Wikidata items on a map, for instance.

Volunteers welcome:

- Create new icons in the same style
- Import new icons created by people working on the various forks of https://github.com/twain47/Open-SVG-Map-Icons/network
- Associate icons to new Wikidata classes. For instance, if the icon for "camping" (the activity) can also be used for "camping ground", then duplicate the icon and name the new file accordingly. Reusing the "dog" icon for "animal" is OK, but reusing the same "dog" icon for all sub-classes of "dog" should be avoided, as applications will typically go to parent classes if an icon is not available.
